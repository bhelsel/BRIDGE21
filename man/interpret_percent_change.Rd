\title{Interpret percent change in a continuous score}
\usage{
interpret_percent_change(x, type, thresholds = c(-5, 5))
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector of scores, ordered by time or visit, where the
first element represents the baseline value.}

\item{type}{A character string specifying the name of the score or measure
(e.g., \code{"fruit and vegetable"}, \code{"sleep"}, \code{"activity"}). This term is
inserted dynamically into the interpretation message.}

\item{thresholds}{A numeric vector of two values indicating the lower and
upper bounds (in percent) for what is considered "about the same".
Defaults to \code{c(-5, 5)}, meaning less than –5\% is a decrease, between –5\%
and +5\% is the same, and greater than +5\% is an increase.}
}
\value{
A character vector of the same length as \code{x}, with a human-readable
interpretation for each value.
}
\description{
Computes and interprets the percent change of a numeric measure relative to
its first (baseline) value. This function provides a short, readable message
describing whether the measure increased, decreased, or stayed about the same
based on customizable thresholds.
}
\details{
The function treats the first value of \code{x} as the baseline score.
Percent change is computed as:
\deqn{((x - baseline) / baseline) * 100}

Change categories are determined using \code{\link[base]{cut}} with
boundaries \code{c(-Inf, thresholds, Inf)}. The first observation is always
labeled \code{"baseline"}.

The returned messages include:
\itemize{
\item \strong{"Baseline measurement"}
\item \strong{"Nice job! You increased your \link{type} score by X\%"}
\item \strong{"Your \link{type} score decreased by X\%"}
\item \strong{"Your \link{type} score stayed about the same"}
}
}
\examples{
# Default thresholds
interpret_percent_change(c(400, 420, 395, 410), type = "fruit and vegetable")

# Custom thresholds for a stricter definition of "same"
interpret_percent_change(c(100, 104, 110), type = "activity", thresholds = c(-3, 3))
