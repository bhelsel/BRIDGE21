\textbf{pTau217}: This is a blood measure that can reflect both amyloid and tau related changes in the brain. An increase in pTau217 levels, especially above 0.40 pg/mL, suggest microscopic Alzheimer’s related change may be present in the brain. This is not a diagnostic test but in patients with memory changes this test can suggest that memory problems may be related to Alzheimer’s changes in the brain. In those without memory problems, we are still studying if an abnormal test result can be used to predict long term risk. False positive and false negative test results can occur.
