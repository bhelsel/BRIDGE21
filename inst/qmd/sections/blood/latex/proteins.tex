\subsection{Alzheimer's disease-related proteins}

When we’re born, the levels of two proteins in our brain, called β-amyloid and tau, are normal. As we age, these levels can change. β-amyloid protein changes happen first, sometimes even 10-20 years before any noticeable problems with thinking or memory start. However, it is important to know that not everyone with changes in β-amyloid levels will develop memory issues.

Tau protein changes usually occur after β-amyloid changes and are more closely linked to actual symptoms of memory and thinking difficulties. As the levels of both β-amyloid and tau change over time, the likelihood of experiencing memory changes generally increases.
