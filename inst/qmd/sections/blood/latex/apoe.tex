\subsection{Genetic blood tests regarding Alzheimer’s disease risk}

From past research, we know a version of the APOE gene, known as APOE4, increases a person’s risk for developing Alzheimer’s disease. We are still learning about how APOE4 impacts someone with Down syndrome’s risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease, but current research suggest people with APOE4 may develop signs of Alzheimer’s disease earlier then people without it.

We inherit the APOE genes from our parents. Each parent passes one copy on to us, resulting in each of us having two copies of every gene, one copy from our dad, and one from our mom. If you carry the APOE4 gene, it means either your mom, your dad, or both (a rarer scenario) passed it on to you.
