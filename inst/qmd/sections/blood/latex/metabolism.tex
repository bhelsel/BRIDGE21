\subsection{Lipid and Glucose Tests}

Lipid and glucose tests are blood tests that help us understand your heart health and blood sugar levels.

\textbf{Understanding Lipids}: Lipids are fats in your blood. We measure several types of cholesterol and triglycerides to assess your heart health.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{HDL Cholesterol} is often called "good cholesterol" because it helps remove other forms of cholesterol from your blood. A healthy level is above 40 mg/dL.
    
    \item \textbf{LDL Cholesterol} is sometimes called "bad cholesterol" because too much of it can build up in your blood vessels. A healthy level is below 100 mg/dL.
    
    \item \textbf{Total Cholesterol} measures all the cholesterol in your blood. A healthy level is below 200 mg/dL.
    
    \item \textbf{Triglycerides} are another type of fat that comes mainly from the food we eat. A healthy level is below 150 mg/dL.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Understanding Blood Sugar}: We also measure how your body processes sugar.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Glucose} tells us your blood sugar level at the time of the test. A healthy fasting level is below 100 mg/dL.
    
    \item \textbf{HbA1c} shows your average blood sugar over the past 2-3 months. A healthy level is below 5.7\%. This test helps us understand whether you might be at risk for diabetes.
\end{itemize}

Keeping these levels in a healthy range helps protect your heart and overall health.
