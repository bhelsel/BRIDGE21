\subsection{Lipid and Glucose Tests}

Lipid and glucose tests are blood tests that help us understand your heart health and blood sugar levels. 

Lipids are fats in your blood. We measure cholesterol (HDL, LDL, and total cholesterol) and triglycerides. HDL is often called "good cholesterol" because it helps remove other forms of cholesterol from your blood. LDL is sometimes called "bad cholesterol" because too much of it can build up in your blood vessels. Triglycerides are another type of fat that comes mainly from the food we eat.

We also measure glucose (blood sugar) and HbA1c. Glucose tells us your blood sugar level at the time of the test. HbA1c shows your average blood sugar over the past 2-3 months. These tests help us understand how your body is processing sugar and whether you might be at risk for diabetes.

Keeping these levels in a healthy range helps protect your heart and overall health.
