\subsection{Physical Activity and Sleep}

Exercise really is the best medicine! We encourage you to do at least 30 minutes a day of activity that significantly raises your heart rate and breathing rate. For significant health benefits, adults need at least:

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item 150 minutes of brisk walking or similar each week
    \item Two days of strengthening activities for all major muscle groups
  \end{enumerate}    

Sleep also helps improve our memory and focus on our daily tasks. At least 8 hours of sleep is important for our brains. It looks like you achieved the physical activity and sleep recommendations on \textbf{{paSleepSuccess}} of the \textbf{{accelDaysMonitored}} days you were monitored with the accelerometer (\colorbox{skyblue}{highlighted in blue}).
