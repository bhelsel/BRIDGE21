\subsection{Dual Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry}

A Dual Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry (DXA) helps determine your current levels of body fat, lean tissue, and bone density. Your body composition is everything that makes up your body. This includes muscles, bones, organs, and fat. Your body composition is affected by age, gender, genetics, physical fitness, and diet. A higher amount of fat-free mass (muscles and bones) and a lower amount of fat mass can help you not get sick as often. The best way to improve your fat-free mass is through healthy eating and regular exercise. Remember, everybody has a different body and will have a different body composition. Be happy with your body no matter what shape or size!
