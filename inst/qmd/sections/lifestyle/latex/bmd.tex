A BMD Z-score less than 0 indicates bone mineral density below the average for
someone of the same age and sex. A Z-score below -2.0 is considered below the
expected range and may suggest an increased risk for fractures or other
musculoskeletal complications, especially when accompanied by other risk
factors.
