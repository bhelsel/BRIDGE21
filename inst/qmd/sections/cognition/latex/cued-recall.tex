\subsection{Modified Cued Recall Test}

This test assesses learning and your ability to remember a set of pictures
during a free recall trial or cued recall trial (i.e., either freely recalled or
recalling after being given a cue). Lower scores may suggest difficulties with
learning or memory; however, a single low score does not necessarily indicate
impairment. Clinicians typically examine changes in performance over time to
determine whether a meaningful shift in cognitive status is occurring.
