\subsection{Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale}

The Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales assess how well a person manages everyday activities that are important for independent living and social participation. 
It evaluates practical skills (such as dressing, cooking, and managing money), social skills (like communicating and getting along with others), and daily living skills (such as personal care and following routines). 
Results provide insight into how an individual functions in daily life compared to others of the same age.
